For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index's history.In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest

                    <p>From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.In 2020, he moved to Texas, saying that California had become "complacent" about its economic success.While hosting Saturday Night Live in May 2021, Musk said that he has Asperger syndrome.
                    </p>
                    <p>Musk met his first wife, Canadian Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; and they married in 2000.In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.After his death, the couple decided to use IVF to continue their family.They had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.In 2022, one of the twins officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity, and to use Wilson as her last name because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.In an October 2022 interview with FT.com, Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as "the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists</p>
                    <p>In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.Musk was later accused by Johnny Depp of having an affair with Heard while she was still married to Depp.Musk and Heard both denied the affair.</p>
                    <p>In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating.Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.According to Musk and Grimes, his name was "X Æ A-12"; however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,and was then changed to "X Æ A-Xii". This drew more confusion, as Æ is not a letter in the modern English alphabet.The child was eventually named X AE A-XII Musk, with "X" as a first name, "AE A-XII" as a middle name, and "Musk" as surname.In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk (nicknamed "Y"), born via surrogacy.Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were "semi-separated" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: "I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid."Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again but remained on good terms</p>
                    <p>In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news "raise[d] questions about workplace ethics", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.Musk denied the report</p>
